[00:09.34] Like you, I'm often amused the times I think back on the past
[00:18.19] Right here, our ancestors used to love irrational acts
[00:45.19] 
[00:26.39] One glance, one look was all it took to signal a touch of fingers locking
[00:35.13] Fingers then the skin would entreat the skin nothing said
[00:43.60] I've heard it told that all they did was loosen control as lips would
[00:51.86] Come to lips and thighs to wrists and through give and take, take and give
[01:28.86] 
[01:04.09] I can't imagine it now, seems rather pointless anyhow
[01:12.57] Plus if you tried it for kicks, you'd get righteously denounced
[01:44.07] 
[01:20.79] Somewhere inside of me, I want to feel and touch and
[01:25.24] One night I had a dream, flowers falling
[01:29.20] It seems something has gone away, I want to lead it back and
[01:33.91] Sometimes I hear a voice calling, calling me
[01:38.19] But don't take me literally, don't take this seriously
[01:42.61] No, I don't suffer from superstition
[01:46.62] And yet sometimes I have to think about this ancient instinct
[01:51.30] Sometimes I wonder if we've evolved at all
[02:12.30] 
[01:58.33] So yeah I've got this idea but I can't test it on my own
[02:07.25] Be my accomplice in crime, I need you here all alone
[02:33.25] 
[02:20.11] Like you I'm often amused the times I think back on the past
[02:29.02] Right here our ancestors used to like irrational, ecstatic play
[03:00.52] 
[02:54.72] Somewhere inside of me
[03:03.55] One night, I had a dream
[03:11.72] It seems something has gone away
[03:20.66] Sometimes, I hear a voice
